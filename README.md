# Flux-calibrated-spectra
For each quasar, the combined VIS + NIR spectrum rebinned to 50 km/s and normalized to the J(AB) magnitude (reported in D'Odorico et al. 2023) is released. 
These tables are created from the telluric corrected spectra and have the following columns:

- x: wavelength in the vacuum-heliocentric system (nm); 
- xmin: minimum wavelength of the pixel (nm);
- xmax: maximum wavelength of the pixel (nm);
- y: flux density with the telluric features removed (erg cm-2 s-1 A-1);
- dy: error of the flux density (erg cm-2 s-1 A-1).
